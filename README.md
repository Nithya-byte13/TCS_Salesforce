Salesforce Customer Support Case Management is a declarative Salesforce solution that automates case assignment, escalation, and email notifications while providing real-time reports and dashboards. It uses assignment rules, queues, record-triggered flows, email alerts, and dashboards to improve support efficiency and visibility.

Steps to Implement:

Salesforce Setup: Sign up for a Developer Edition org and verify System Administrator access.

User Creation: Create users such as support agents and managers with proper profiles and roles.

Case Object Configuration: Ensure necessary fields (Case Type, Status) exist and create queues for support agents.

Assignment Rules: Set up rules to automatically assign cases based on criteria like case type.

Flows & Email Alerts: Create record-triggered flows for case creation and escalation; configure email templates and alerts.

Reports & Dashboards: Build reports for open cases, cases by type, and escalated cases; create dashboards to visualize metrics.

Testing: Create test cases to verify automatic assignment, escalation, and email notifications.

Report & Metadata Export: Export reports manually and use Workbench to export reports, dashboards, and email templates to GitHub.

Email Verification & Security: Ensure email deliverability, verify user emails, check log files, and confirm sharing/security settings.
